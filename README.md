# **Customer_Churn_Prediction** 📊

## **Project Description** 📝  
The **Customer Churn Prediction** project aims to identify customers most likely to churn in order to reduce attrition rates and minimize financial losses for the company. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, this project helps design effective strategies to improve customer retention.

## **Main Objectives** 🎯  
- ✅ Identify customers at high risk of churn.  
- ✅ Understand customer behaviors through segmentation analysis.  
- ✅ Reduce financial losses caused by customer attrition.  
- ✅ Compare the performance of various classification algorithms.  
- ✅ Provide clear and intuitive visualizations to better understand the results.

## **Project Features** ⚙️  
- 🔄 Data preprocessing and normalization.  
- 📊 Analysis and selection of key features.  
- 🤖 Comparison of multiple classification models, including:  
  - **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**  
  - **Random Forest**  
  - **Decision Tree**  
  - **Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)**  
  - **XGBoost**  
  - **AdaBoost**  
- 📈 Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, recall, F1-score, and AUC.  
- 🧩 Clustering with **K-Means** to analyze churn customer behaviors.  
- 🔍 Dimensionality reduction using **PCA** and visualization of clusters in 2D.
